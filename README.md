## Inspirations and references

### [Travelling Salesman Problem: Parallel Implementations & Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14352.pdf)
The project implements several approaches to parallelize the Brute Force TSP algorithm, including OpenMPI, MPI and CUDA programming.
In my project I want to provide a better idea about relative importance of selecting a good algorithm and parallelizing an algorithm by solving TSP with
a non-exact algorithm such as Branch&Bound or Genetic Algorithms.
